Our research adopts the null model approach for the proposed DIF models, which evaluates the impact of drug information on the model's prediction performance. 
The null model serves as a reference point to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the model by excluding certain drug information. It provides the performance 
metrics found in Table 4 and Figure 6 of the Manuscript.
